The story is well known - the Wizard of the Tiny Cave was, once upon a time, just a man, whose ambition far outstripped his ability.  He wanted to make something of himself, and live a life that was big and sprawling and action-packed.  He wanted to create things, and leave behind an amazing story or two.  He was big on ideas, but short on, well, any of the things he needed to make such things.

Filled with despair and disappointment and despondence and other words beginning with d, he gave up on his ideas and went into finance and accounting.

And there his boring story would have ended, were it not for the fact that he went off the deep end, went into the country and mountains, and found a tiny little cave.  He filled it with all sorts of dangers, oddities, and the occasional Very Valuable Thing.

You are not in that cave.  Not yet.  You'll get to it in a bit.

You are instead standing in an open field south of a white house, with a boarded up front door.  There is a mailbox here.

"So, an adventurous sort, eh?  Willing to take quests and and go off to strange and possibly dangerous locations, in the off chance of finding treasure and interesting things?  You're just who I need to see!  I got a quest for ya.  There was a pretty big storm, and it blew my washing all over the forest.  And then on top of that I'd left my mother's ring in a pocket in the washing somewhere!  Be a dear and go find that too, thanks."

As you already have everything she wants, you hand the wayward washing and the ring over to the woman.

"Oh wow, I knew I could count on you!  You'd already found it all already!  So, hey.  Thanks for that!  And I've got another quest for ya.  A much more interesting quest.  Somewhere nearby is *the* Tiny Cave, where once I went looking for a fortune in treasure and gold.  Didn't get squat, and I dropped my mother's favourite cake recipe somewhere in the place.  I've asked a bunch of people to go find it for me, though some of them what entered ain't never been seen again.  Others say that magic and weird stuff works in the cave.  Anyway, you're an adventurous sort, do be a dear and go find my cake recipe for me, willya?  You can find the cave entrance in the mountains to the south."

As you enter the Tiny Cave, your eyes blink, adjusting to the dim light - you're probably going to need some sort of light source.  But before you can think much further on that, there is a very solid THUMP as you are hit in the back of the head, and you lose consciousness.

You awake in a gloomy cavern, surrounded by stalagmites, and with your hands tied tightly together.  You are very feeling very sore, as if you were hit hard in the head, dragged for a while, and then dumped into this cave.

At the top of the rockface a man appears - details are hard to make out at this distance but it's pretty obvious he has a big crazy white beard and big crazy white hair.  "Hey down there!" he calls.  "Welcome to the cave!  You're going to need these!"  He follows up throwing some tinned fish and bottled water down to you.

He moves away from the edge and disappears from sight.

> Go West

You go to Tribal Cavern.

At the west end of the Sloping Passage, there are a couple of people, dressed in a very bizarre style.  They're wearing what you might call "tribal-ish" clothes, with a hodgepodge of furs and teeth and claws and loincloths and such.  But in addition to all the archetypical tribal-ish gear, they're wearing bits of smashed-up crockery and twisted forks and bent spoons.  For weapons, they're wielding kitchen knives that look quite incredibly sharp.

---

As you approach, in your purloined shrine outfit, their eyes light up and they start talking excitedly, though you can't understand a word they're saying.

After a few moments, they seem to recognise that you can't understand them.  Rather than getting suspicious, one of them turns, and beckons you to come with her.  You follow her into a large cavern.

---

In the middle of the large cavern is a hole.  You look through it and can see a lot of sharp looking stalagmites below.

But the main obvious feature of this cavern is that it's filled with people.  Most of them are dressed in what you would think of 'typical tribal-ish' gear, with furs and teeth and claws, and not very much.  But some, who look like guards, or more important figures, are wearing the 'smashed-up crockery armor' look.

When the people see you all chatter stops immediately - they stare at you openmouthed.  Some of them drop to their knees and start kowtowing.

---

The guard takes you to one of the more important looking figures and talks at length.  The important-looking figure is a large fat man with a headband made of spoons twisted together, which have been polished to an amazing shine.  He nods, and then dismisses the guard with a wave.  She goes back to the cavern entrance.

The man turns to you, and gets out an old, yellowing piece of paper, studies it carefully, and says, in halting pronunciation, "Wun Kahp Shoo-gar?"

---

He sees your expression and looks happy and launches into a stream of gibberish, none of which you understand.  When he realises you aren't understanding him, he looks at you quizzically, and consults his paper again.  "Too Stikk But-tah?  Hahf kahp mllk?  Phoower Aigs?"

"One cup sugar?" you ask.  "Two sticks of butter?  Half a cup of milk? Four eggs?  What is this?"

"Ah, so even the gods must modernise," the man says sadly.  "But I suppose it makes sense.  After all, we don't actually use 'wunhahfkahpphaloower'or 'tuhereekahpcuhohcualahtte' anymore.  So, welcome to your humble servants, Wunkahpshoogar!"  He turns to the crowd and shouts.  "The god walks amongst us!"

A great party ensues.

> Go East (to Sloping Passage)

A great hue and cry goes up.  While everybody was partying like mad and they didn't notice you dropping the recipe through the hole in the floor, they have now noticed it is missing.  The leader absolutely FREAKS OUT.

"AUIII!  Truly we are accursed!  No matter how much and how many we sacrifice to you, Wunkahpshoo-gar, we remain stuck in this cave, unable to leave, and now even the Holy Words are gone!  Why don't we just sacrifice *you*?!?

That gives him an idea.  "Hey now.  Nothing else has worked.  And you're a god, so it won't be permanent.  Let's give it a shot!"

You are thrown into the hole in the middle of the cavern.  The stalagmites below rush towards you and you wonder if you are about to die, you land with a very painful CRUNCH, but miraculously you are alive and unbroken.

"Excellent, excellent... oh!  You have to remember!  Beware the lobster!!!  So!  How's it hanging?" he continues.  "Hopefully not limply and dead!  Don't want you killing yourself!"

Only then can you empty your mind of greed and material thought, and continue on the path to understanding and transcendence."

With nothing burdening you, and facing nothingness before you, you take a deep breath, and step forwards, arms wide, to embrace the nothingness all around you.

You are falling, falling, falling, but you feel as light as a feather, you feel as if you are drifting, and you find yourself touching down in a very familiar place.

Player's move types are now standard,parkour,climb
"How curious..." says a voice in your head.  "The old adventuress has been trying for decades to achieve what you just did in less than a day.

"You will need to depart this place, but only to return what once was taken.  You have leave to do so.  Beware, few have reached this point, and none have succeeded.  Once, one almost made it, but he returned in failure, full of ravings, his mind gone."

> I shall.

"Go.  Return what was taken."

Player's move types are now standard,parkour,climb
"OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD!" she cries.  "You did it!  You got Mum's recipe back!  Thankyouthankyouthankyou!  I knew you could do it!"

> So, uh, where did you get the necklace from?

Her expression sours.  "The necklace thing again?  Oh, come on, it was just one little thing in a massive hoard!  Surely I'm allowed to take one little thing from massive treasure hoards in caves?"

Player's move types are now standard,parkour,climb

> You, uh, kinda created a curse on the cave by doing that.

"A curse?"

"No-one in the cave can get out."

"Oh!  That explains why I could never get back in!  But still, you got out and brought my recipe back so all's well!"

"The cave curse is kinda still going, and it wants your necklace back," you hopefully say.

"Eh, whatever.  Heeeey!  I know!  I just recently got this delivery of some amazing-tasting seafood.  Here, have some of that, if you like!"  She hopefully holds something that smells vaguely seafoody towards you, wrapped in newspaper.

Player's move types are now standard,parkour,climb

> REMEMBER!  BEWARE THE LOBSTER!!!

"No thanks!" you say, rejecting her offer.

"What?  NO!  NO NO NO!  It'll come after me now!"

"What'll come after you?"

A Giant Enemy Lobster appears.  The House Owner has a moment to scream, then the lobster hits her in a weak spot for massive damage.  There is a massive amount of magical blowback and an enormous explosion.

You regain consciousness up in the branches of a tree.

> Use Lost Necklace with Treasure

(Taking the Lost Necklace first...)
You get the Lost Necklace out of the carrybag.
You return the necklace to the treasure hoard.

"At last," the voice says in your head.  "Together again!  All affected by the curse, yourself included, are now completely free of its effects!  You may go tell them the good news.  Thank you for all your efforts."

You go to the sage first.  She nods, calmly and serenely accepting the news.  "Thank you for all your efforts.  But I shall not return to my old life.  I feel much calmer now.  To the one who cursed us here... I feel... regret.  I also, regretfully, feel anger.

"Besides, I'm also a bit too old now to go jumping and climbing around old caves and tombs and whatnot."

---

You consider how best to tell the Crockery Tribe.  How would they handle the truth, to learn that their gods were never real?  That they were stuck in the cave for so long because of Dotty's mistake?

You go to them in costume and spin them a story of god fighting god for their freedom, and you give them the Recipe - their Holy Words - back to the Leader.

"I think perhaps we no longer need those Holy Words, Wunkahpshoo-gar.  They have caused us far too much trouble."

"That's probably for the best," you say diplomatically.

---

They were the easy ones.

---

You take Dotty's cake recipe back to her.  All she wanted was a treasured memento of a mother long gone, of her childhood, back again.  But it was denied to her, for so incredibly long, and in her anger and desperation she caused so much anguish and despair for so many people in the Tiny Cave.

"I'm not sure what, exactly, you deserve, Dotty.  But one thing you should definitely have is your mother's recipe back," you say.  You press the recipe into her hands.

---

You don't even know the Crazy Old Guy's name, or anything you can do for him.

"I see now you were only trying to help, to warn me... thank you."

---

"Oorgh... oh, wow, my mind feels so clear now!  You know what it's like to be affected by two mind-affecting enchantments at the same time?  For 50 years?  It's murder on the old brain is what it is."

"You...you're alive?"

"Of course I'm alive, I'm talking to you right now, aren't I?  Help me up, goshdarnit!  My back is murder after a Lobster transformation.  You got any idea what it's like to turn into a giant enemy lobster when you're over 70?  It hits your joints in the weak spots for massive damage."

He gets up and decides not to.  "And get me some goshdurned pants too."

---

YOU HAVE FINISHED.

Thanks for playing!  Your score is 4 shcmaltzy scenes out of 4.
