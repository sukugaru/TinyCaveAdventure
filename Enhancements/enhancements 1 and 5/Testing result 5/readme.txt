Checking movement b/w high ledge and stalagmite cave.  This has also meant adding Pathways to the High Ledge, so need to make sure you can move north from it into the maze properly.

Starting at the High Ledge.  We have this:

=====
You see the crazy old guy hurrying towards you, carrying a rock.  He sees you jump up to the ledge and sighs.  "Well, so much for that then," he says, and throws the rock over the side of the ledge.  "So you're going to want to kill yourself, I see," he says.

"Hi!" he says, his eyes only slightly vibrating.

> What do you mean, I'm trying to kill myself?

"Lots of people come, and nobody leaves.  The best way to stay alive is to not struggle!  Struggling is bad.  It's never worked and then you fall and land on the table.  But you're struggling anyway, though I'm trying to save you.  Which is clearly not working.  So follow me!"

He squeezes through the crack in the wall.  Just before he vanishes from sight he turns and beckons to you to follow him.

You squeeze through the crack, following the old man.  It is *very* tight and it branches into a dizzying maze of narrow and twisty passages and it all looks the same.  Eventually he leads you out of the maze and you arrive at the maze's entrance.

"Toodles!" he says.  "Maybe you won't actually kill yourself.  Let's find out!"  With that he wanders eastwards.

In a corner you can see an old discarded book.

PASS

High ledge's down path and stalagmite cave's up path both need climb and this works.
High ledge's north path is done with the Pathways system and it works - first time you go to maze entrance, and second time you go into the maze.

Then let's check one last thing at the end, and see if the jumping bit still works.

=====

> Jump up to Stalagmite base

You jump to the stalagmite base from the stalagmite base.  As you land, you make quite some noise.

You hear a voice from above.  "Hey!  What's all that noise?" it shouts.

> Jump up to Boulder

You hear a voice from above.  "Hey!  What's all that noise?" it shouts.

> Jump up to Ledge

You jump to the ledge from the boulder.  As you land, you crash into the side of the rockface and disturb a bunch of pebbles, which clatter to the ground far below.

You hear a voice from above.  "Hey!  What's all that noise?" it shouts.

> Jump up to Precarious Platform

You jump to the precarious platform from the ledge.  As you land, the platform wobbles and grinds against its precarious perch, making an enormous clatter.  Above you, just within jumping reach, is the top of the rock face.

You hear a voice from above.  "Hey!  What's all that noise?" it shouts.

Player's move types are now standard

> Jump up
