The story is well known - the Wizard of the Tiny Cave was, once upon a time, just a man, whose ambition far outstripped his ability.  He wanted to make something of himself, and live a life that was big and sprawling and action-packed.  He wanted to create things, and leave behind an amazing story or two.  He was big on ideas, but short on, well, any of the things he needed to make such things.

Filled with despair and disappointment and despondence and other words beginning with d, he gave up on his ideas and went into finance and accounting.

And there his boring story would have ended, were it not for the fact that he went off the deep end, went into the country and mountains, and found a tiny little cave.  He filled it with all sorts of dangers, oddities, and the occasional Very Valuable Thing.

You are not in that cave.  Not yet.  You'll get to it in a bit.

You are instead standing in an open field south of a white house, with a boarded up front door.  There is a mailbox here.

In a corner you can see an old discarded book.

You put the tattered book into the carrybag.

> Go East

You go to Central Cavern.

> Go Northeast

You go to Sage's Grotto.

> Talk to Wise old sage

The sage opens her eyes as you approach, and studies you thoughtfully.  "Up hill and mountain, and down dale, and through storm, thick and clearing, and even up in the trees, you shall find your path," she says.

> Go Southwest (to Central Cavern)

> Go Up

You walk through the twisty little tunnels and passages and end up at a Special Maze Location.

> Look at Map

At first this just looks like some sort of abstract art, drawn on the side of the wall.  As you study it closer, you realise it's actually a map of the maze!  You can see how to get from here back to the Maze Entrance, and back to the High Ledge.

> Use Map

Where do you want to go?

> Go to High Ledge

You walk through the twisty little tunnels and they get *very* narrow and you have to really squeeze through the last bits, and you end up back at the High Ledge.

You see the crazy old guy hurrying towards you, carrying a rock.  He sees you jump up to the ledge and sighs.  "Well, so much for that then," he says, and throws the rock over the side of the ledge.  "So you're going to want to kill yourself, I see," he says.

> Talk to Crazy Guy

"Hi!" he says, his eyes only slightly vibrating.

> What do you mean, I'm trying to kill myself?

"Lots of people come, and nobody leaves.  The best way to stay alive is to not struggle!  Struggling is bad.  It's never worked and then you fall and land on the table.  But you're struggling anyway, though I'm trying to save you.  Which is clearly not working.  So follow me!"

He squeezes through the crack in the wall.  Just before he vanishes from sight he turns and beckons to you to follow him.

> Jump down to Precarious Platform

You jump to the precarious platform from the high ledge.  As you land, the platform wobbles and grinds against its precarious perch, making an enormous clatter.  Above you, just within jumping reach, is the top of the rock face.

> Jump down to Ledge

You jump to the ledge from the precarious platform.  As you land, you crash into the side of the rockface and disturb a bunch of pebbles, which clatter to the ground far below.

> Jump down to Boulder

You jump to the boulder from the ledge.  As you land, you make quite some noise.

> Jump down to Stalagmite base

You jump to the stalagmite base from the boulder.  As you land, you make quite some noise.

> Jump down

You jump down to the rocky floor of the Stalagmite Cave.

(Taking it first...)

You put the chunk of stalagmite into the carrybag.

> Put Chunk of Stalactite into Carrybag

> Jump up to Precarious Platform

> Jump up

You jump up, just making it to the top of the rockface.

> Go North (to Maze Entrance)

You squeeze through the crack, following the old man.  It is *very* tight and it branches into a dizzying maze of narrow and twisty passages and it all looks the same.  Eventually he leads you out of the maze and you arrive at the maze's entrance.

"Toodles!" he says.  "Maybe you won't actually kill yourself.  Let's find out!"  With that he wanders eastwards.

> Go East (to Central Cavern)

You go to Central Cavern.

> Look at Vending Machine

Inexplicably, in the middle of this tiny cave you're in, there is a vending machine.

> Use Vending Machine

While you might be tied up, it's not too hard to use the vending machine.
