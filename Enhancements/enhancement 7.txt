In the Pathways class, have methods that add and remove movement types.

-

It should be easy enough!

To add movement type "x", first make sure it's not already there (indexof), and add ",x".

To remove movement type, make sure it's there (indexof), and remove(x).

Then to deal with commas, do something like this:

string s = ",blah,blah,,blah,blah,,,";
s = s.Trim(',');
s = s.Replace(",,", ",");
OutMessage += s + "\n";

Created these methods in the pathway class.

        public void AddType(string s)
        {
            if (sMovementTypes.IndexOf(s) == 0)
            {
                sMovementTypes += "," + s;
            }
            sMovementTypes = sMovementTypes.Trim(',');
            sMovementTypes = sMovementTypes.Replace(",,", ",");
        }

        public void RemoveType(string s)
        {
            if (sMovementTypes.IndexOf(s) != 0)
            {
                sMovementTypes = sMovementTypes.Replace(s, "");
            }
            sMovementTypes = sMovementTypes.Trim(',');
            sMovementTypes = sMovementTypes.Replace(",,", ",");
        }

No, hang about, now that I'm looking at debugging this, it's become clear this isn't quite the right approach.

The reason I thought of this enhancement is because I'm adding and removing "climb" from the player's movement types, and it's a very basic approach that just adds and removes ",climb".  Obviously this won't always work.

We have movementTypes as a thing that exists in the Pathway class and the player class.  So those methods would be better in a MovementTypesList type class... except, why not just change the Pathway class and the player class to use a List of strings?  That way you don't need to worry about commas.  But then what do you need to change elsewhere in the code?

I could be sneaky and use my customextensions class to create "AddMovementType" and "RemoveMovementType" methods to all strings.  This isn't a very nice solution though.

Needs more thought.

Have rolled back location.cs and world.cs.

-

LATER
Change movementTypes in Pathway and Player to a List of strings.
Lists have Remove and Add methods.
MoveTo has a bit where it looks at pathways and available movement types etc. This would definitely need adjusting.

LATER AGAIN

Have found Bug 10.  Locked and blocked don't work!  This is getting messier than I thought.

Also, this is currently what you have to do to modify the movement types of a pathway...

string TypeToAdd = "climb";
string TypeToRemove = "fly";
pathway p1 = World._centralCavern.Pathways.Find(x => x.dir == World._South);
string s1 = p1.sMovementTypes;
s1 += TypeToAdd;                  // to add
s1 = s1.Replace(TypeToRemove,""); // to remove
s1 = s1.Trim(',');
s1 = s1.Replace(",,", ",");
p1.sMovementTypes = s1;

It's messy.
