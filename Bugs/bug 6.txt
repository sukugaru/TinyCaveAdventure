I have a class called Object, dating back to my very first attempts to write something like this.  Problem is, Object is a C# keyword, and so needs to be referred to as Engine.Object all the time.  Is there a better name I can use?

Investigation
This is simple to do.  Highlight the "Object.cs" filename in the file list in the upper right of the screen.  Press F2, rename file.  This is VS2013 so you get a dialog asking if you want to change the name of the class throughout the project.  So the main trick is figuring out a better name for the class.
ADDITION 7/6/2017: How about "Item"?
Experimented on a copy of all files and it seems to work!  Do the rename of Object to Item, then find-and-replace to replace "Engine.Item" with "Item", and it compiles and works.  Now doing this for real...

Main test
Does it still compile?

Yes.
