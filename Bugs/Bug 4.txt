Issue:

In a Conversation, HandleResponse seems to be getting called twice.  To see this, set a conversation's HandleResponse to add to OutMessage, but not end the conversation.

You can see this by putting the following into the crazy guy's conversation's HandleResponse:
   if (Response == "Hi.")
   {
      // Adding this next line
      OutMessage += "Hi there test line!\n";
      iNode = 2;
   }
When running through the conversation, "Hi there test line!" appears twice.

Workaround:

In a conversation, if HandleResponse() is not ending the conversation, then don't add to OutMessage, and merely set internal variables to ensure that when GetDialogue() is called, it adds to OutMessage.

-

Investigation:

In UI.cs, after HandleResponse, OutMessage might be populated.  If the conversation is still going, then GetDialogue gets called, and this also adds to OutMessage.

OutMessage isn't cleared before calling GetDialogue!  This is why the OutMessage of HandleResponse appears twice.

Code changes

UI.cs 
// 20/5/2017 - SS - Bug 4 - In button1_click, during the conversation handling code.  After
// HandleResponse(), make sure to clear OutMessage before calling GetDialogue, to avoid the
// result of HandleResponse being output twice.
