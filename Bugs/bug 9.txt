Issue:
player.TieUp() doesn't set player.bTiedUp!

Fix:
Make sure that it does.
If it's not set in player.TieUp() then it must be set in location.cs somewhere, so comment that out.

Testing:
Run through prologue, and confirm that in the stalagmite cave the diagnosis says "you are tied up"
PASS

Code Changes:
Player.cs
// 24/5/2017 - Bug 9 - TieUp() didn't actually set bTiedUp!

Location.cs
cave entrance, PostAction()
Commenting out the "player.bTiedUp = true" bit
