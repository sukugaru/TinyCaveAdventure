To speed this up a bit, putting chunks of stalactite and stalagmite into the central cavern.

=====

The story is well known - the Wizard of the Tiny Cave was, once upon a time, just a man, whose ambition far outstripped his ability.  He wanted to make something of himself, and live a life that was big and sprawling and action-packed.  He wanted to create things, and leave behind an amazing story or two.  He was big on ideas, but short on, well, any of the things he needed to make such things.

Filled with despair and disappointment and despondence and other words beginning with d, he gave up on his ideas and went into finance and accounting.

And there his boring story would have ended, were it not for the fact that he went off the deep end, went into the country and mountains, and found a tiny little cave.  He filled it with all sorts of dangers, oddities, and the occasional Very Valuable Thing.

Your options are:
1. XXium Saw (cost: Lemonade)
2. Paper and Stationery Kit (cost: 1 tin of tinned fish)
3. Parkour Manual (cost: 1 chunk of stalagmite + 1 chunk of stalactite)

> Look at Carrybag

A bag with a long strap, easily carried over one shoulder.  It looks old and threadbare, but still usable.
