Issue:
Action_Take.cs, DoAction:  There's code for taking the lost necklace, that always gives a paragraph about Dotty, even if she's not present.  That needs fixing.

Investigation:
Simple enough!  Action_Take.cs, DoAction, if the object being taken is the lost necklace, assumes that the player is taking it from Dotty's body and that the player is in the ruins of the house.  Put a location check around the Dotty paragraph.

Fix:
In DoAction, the "if (i == World._lostGemNecklace)" check has been extended to:
if ((i == World._lostGemNecklace) && (World._player.CurrentLocation == World._BackDoor))


Testing:
Set up a test scenario where MakeRuins() has been partially done, so that _BackDoor is now in ruins and the questGiver has been changed into Dotty.
Go to Back Door.
Pick up the necklace and confirm that you get the "taking care to disturb Dotty as least as possible."
Move to another location, drop the necklace, and pick it up, and confirm there's no mention of Dotty.

PASS



Code changes:
Action_Take.cs: change to DoAction
