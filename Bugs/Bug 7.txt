Issue:
The language used by the Crockery Tribe is not consistent.
1) The guards warn you to go away but you can't understand them.
2) The Elder tries speaking to you when you're disgused and you can't understand him.
3) When he realises you don't understand, he switches to 'modern English'.
2 can make sense, if the Elder is speaking in an archaic language.  However 1 and 3 are not consistent with each other.

Investigation:
When the guards warn you to go away in (1), there's no actual mention of them talking to you in language you don't understand!  This is the idea I had in my head when I wrote the bit with them chasing you away, but the description doesn't explicitly say that it happens.
   So there's no actual problem.

Fix:
None required.
